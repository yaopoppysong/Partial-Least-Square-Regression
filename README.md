Functions
1. PLS.py, package to do the partial least square, including the prediction values and number of components
2. Testcode.py, code to test the PLS and compare the results with the package in Python
3. SimulatedExample.py, code to use simulated data set to predict the dependent variables and obtain the appropriate number of components
4. RealExample.py, code to use real data set to predict the dependent variables and obtain the appropriate number of components
5. Checktime.py, code to check the time of the PLS functions

Report
"Partial Least Square.pdf" is the report to introduce the background of the partial least square and the package to obtain the weights, loadings of X, Y blocks, predict the dependent variables under certain convergence bound and number of components, and get the right number of components for the pls.
